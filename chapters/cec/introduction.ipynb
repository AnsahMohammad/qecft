    "While error correction for classical computation and communication is a well developed and has been for many decades, it is an active area of research in the field of quantum computation and communication. This development is necessary, as without quantum error correction we are unlikely to construct useful quantum computers with current and forseeable levels of engineering technology.\n",

Therefore, I review essential CEC theory before proceeding with QEC theory."

    "## Classical Error Correction\n",
    "I begin by making a more concrete model of the Alice-Bob scenario above. Suppose that Alice wants to send Bob some information, which is in the form of a long stream of bits, called the data stream. The information has to be sent through a noisy transmission channel, as stated above. A simple such channel is one in which, with probability $p$, every bit sent via the channel is flipped. Otherwise, with probability $1-p$, the bit is transmitted with no error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, that Alice wants to send the data stream $101$ to Bob. If she uses the naive strategy and sends the stream as is, the channel could corrupt the bits and, for instance, transform it into $100$. Bob would not have any way to knowing that an error occured during transmission or not. This method only succeeds if there is no error, which has probability $(1-p)^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repetition code\n",
    "Instead, Alice and Bob can agree on some process that increases the probability of correct transmission. One such method is called the 'repetition code'. In this method, instead of sending $0$, Alice sends the *block* of bits $000$, and instead of sending $1$, Alice sends the *block* $111$. This process is called *encoding*, and formally, we use a bar over the message to indicate its encoded form. Hence,\n",
    "$$ \\bar{0} = 000, \\quad \\bar{1} = 111.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if the data stream is $101$, then Alice sends the *code stream*, consisting of three code blocks,\n",
    "$$\\overline{101} == 111000111.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, that Bob receives the corrupted code-stream $101100111$, in which the second and fourth bits have been flipped by the noisy channel. To correct any errors, he will apply a *majority voting algorithm* to each block of three bits in the received code-stream. The first block is $101$, and since there are two 1s in it and one 0, he infers that the first sent bit is likely to be 1. Similarly, he infers from the second and third blocks of three, that the second and third bits are likely to be 0 and 1. Hence, he correctly decodes the message to message was $101$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this method only works if there is at most one bit flip in each block of three. If there are two or more errors, then Bob inferred bit string will be different from the one Alice intended to send. For example, if the corrupted code-string was $101110111$, then using the same algorithm Bob infers that that message was $110$. "
